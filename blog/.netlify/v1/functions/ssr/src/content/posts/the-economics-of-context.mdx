We're building Egregore as a sustainable business, not a venture-backed growth experiment. That means being thoughtful about economics from day one.

This post shares our thinking on pricing, costs, and why we believe context infrastructure can be a healthy business.


## The Model: Free Tools, Paid Infrastructure

The CLI is free and will remain free. The hosted backend service is the business.

This mirrors successful models like Supabase, PlanetScale, and Vercel — free tools, paid infrastructure. You can self-host everything, but most teams will prefer managed infrastructure.

**What the backend provides:**

- Context storage (vector embeddings + raw documents)
- Quest/task state
- Handoff routing and notifications
- Skills registry and versioning
- Team management and permissions
- Org reflection engine


## Why Flat Team Pricing

Our recommended model: $75/month for unlimited users on a team.

Why flat instead of per-seat?

**Terminal-native teams dislike per-seat accounting.** Developer tools that charge per user create friction around adding collaborators. We want the opposite incentive.

**Encourages adding collaborators.** More collaborators means more context, more handoffs, more value from the system. Per-seat pricing discourages exactly what makes Egregore valuable.

**Predictable revenue for planning.** We can forecast without guessing seat counts.

**Usage overages capture value from heavy users.** Beyond included limits, additional storage and retrievals are metered. Heavy teams naturally hit these; light teams never worry about them.


## The Cost Structure

What does it actually cost us to serve a team?

| Component | Service | Est. Cost/User/Month |
|-----------|---------|---------------------|
| Vector Storage | Qdrant Cloud | $0.50 - $1.00 |
| Document Storage | Cloudflare R2 | $0.10 - $0.30 |
| Embeddings | Voyage AI | $0.20 - $0.50 |
| Compute (API) | Railway | $0.30 - $0.50 |
| Relational DB | Neon | $0.20 - $0.40 |
| **Total** | | **$1.30 - $2.70** |

At $75/month for a 5-person team, that's $15/user effective price with 82-91% gross margin.

At 10 users, $7.50/user with 64-83% gross margin.

At 15 users, $5/user with 46-74% gross margin.

**The hybrid model addresses large teams:** heavy usage naturally triggers overage charges, maintaining healthy margins without penalizing normal usage.


## What Drives Costs

**Heavy `/activity` users** — High retrieval volume queries the graph frequently.

**Large context windows** — More tokens embedded means more vector storage and embedding costs.

**Real-time Slack ingestion** — Constant message embedding adds up.

**Org reflection on large teams** — Cross-team queries are compute-intensive.

**Cost optimization levers we're exploring:**

- Self-hosted vector DB (60% cheaper than managed)
- Cheaper embedding models (Voyage lite, open-source)
- Aggressive caching (most retrievals hit recent context)
- Tiered storage (hot/warm/cold)
- Batch reflection (nightly, not real-time)


## The Unit Economics Story

**Customer acquisition cost is low.** Terminal-native tools spread through word of mouth. Developers trust peer recommendations over marketing.

**Free → Team conversion is organic.** Happens when handoffs become essential workflow. No sales pressure needed.

**Gross margins are SaaS-healthy.** 80%+ at our recommended pricing.

**Retention increases over time.** Context lock-in grows with usage. The more handoffs, the more valuable your Egregore history becomes.

**Value scales with model improvements.** Better AI models = more valuable context layer, without proportional cost increase. We're building on an improving foundation.


## The Pricing Table

|  | Free | Team | Enterprise |
|--|------|------|------------|
| **Users** | Up to 3 | Unlimited | Unlimited |
| **Context Storage** | 500 MB | 10 GB included | Custom |
| **Retrievals/month** | 5,000 | 100,000 included | Unlimited |
| **Handoffs** | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| **Skills Sharing** | Community | Team + Community | Private + All |
| **Org Reflection** | — | ✓ | ✓ (Advanced) |
| **Slack Integration** | — | ✓ | ✓ |
| **SSO / Audit Logs** | — | — | ✓ |
| **Price** | $0 | $75/month | Custom |

**Usage-based overages** (beyond Team tier limits):
- Additional storage: $0.15/GB/month
- Additional retrievals: $0.002 per operation
- Org reflection queries: $0.10 each


## What We're Not Doing

**No per-seat pricing.** We want teams to add collaborators freely.

**No annual commitments required.** Monthly is fine. We earn retention through value, not contracts.

**No feature gating on core workflows.** Handoffs work the same on Free and Team. We gate scale and advanced features, not basics.

**No venture-scale growth pressure.** We're building a sustainable business, not optimizing for a funding round.


## The Bet

Context infrastructure is a real category. Teams that manage context well outperform teams that don't. As AI becomes central to knowledge work, context management becomes more valuable, not less.

We're building for that future — one where Egregore is the context layer teams rely on, priced fairly, and sustainable long-term.
