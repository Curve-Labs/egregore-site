The standup meeting exists for one reason: context sync. "What did you work on? What are you working on? What's blocking you?"

For small technical teams — early-stage startups, indie hacker duos, distributed dev shops — this ritual often feels like overhead. The meeting exists separate from where work happens. You stop working to talk about working.

What if context could flow between collaborators without the meeting?


## The Pain Points

Small technical teams share common frustrations:

**Context gets lost between collaborators.** "What did you try?" "Where did you leave off?" Every handoff requires verbal reconstruction of state.

**Project management feels like overhead.** Notion, Linear, Asana — all valuable tools, but they're separate from where work happens. Tab-switching is friction.

**AI conversations are siloed.** You have a great exploration with Claude. Your cofounder has their own. The learning doesn't compound.

**Standups exist just to sync context.** The meeting is a workaround for infrastructure that doesn't exist.


## The Trigger Moment

The moment teams realize they need something different:

> "I spent 30 minutes explaining to my cofounder what I already tried. If only they could see my conversation history."

This is the handoff problem. The context exists — in your head, in your terminal history, in your AI conversation. But there's no path from where it lives to where it's needed.


## The Handoff Loop

Egregore makes handoffs a first-class workflow:

```
Alice works on authentication
       │
       ▼
/handoff to Bob "Auth working, need rate limiting next"
       │
       ├──> Session saved with full context
       ├──> Handoff message attached
       └──> Bob notified via Telegram
              │
              ▼
Bob runs /activity
       │
       ▼
Sees Alice's handoff with:
- What she tried
- What worked
- What didn't
- Exact next steps
       │
       ▼
Picks up exactly where Alice left off
```

**What changes:** Bob doesn't need to ask "what did you try?" The exploration is preserved. The reasoning is preserved. The context transfers with the work.


## Why Terminal-Native Matters

Small technical teams already live in terminal. Git, npm, docker, claude — the work happens there.

A handoff tool that lives in terminal means:

- **Zero context switch** — You don't leave your workflow to document it
- **Capture as byproduct** — The AI conversation *is* the context
- **No new tools to learn** — It's just another command

The insight: context should accumulate automatically during work, not require a separate capture step.


## The Conversion Path

We see teams adopt Egregore in a predictable pattern:

1. **Start with 2 people** — Free tier. Handoffs feel like a nice-to-have.

2. **Add a 3rd collaborator** — Handoffs become essential. Context sync meetings start feeling redundant.

3. **Hit the value of shared context** — "Wait, I can see what everyone is working on without asking?"

4. **4th person joins** — Team tier. The org has institutional memory now.

The handoff sells the workflow. Once you've done it, going back feels like regression.


## What We're Hearing

From teams using Egregore for async collaboration:

> "We dropped our daily standup. The `/activity` command shows me everything I need."

> "My cofounder is in a different timezone. Before, we'd lose a day to context sync. Now I hand off at EOD and he picks up immediately."

> "The AI remembers what we've tried. It's like having a team member with perfect memory."


## The Broader Pattern

Standups are a symptom, not the disease. The disease is infrastructure that doesn't support context flow.

When context flows naturally — as a byproduct of work, not a separate documentation step — the meetings that existed to compensate become optional.

Not every team will drop standups entirely. Some value the social function. But when the *functional* purpose (context sync) is handled by infrastructure, the meeting can serve its *social* purpose without the overhead.


## Getting Started

If you're a small technical team frustrated by context loss:

1. **Try one handoff.** End your work session with `/handoff` instead of just closing the terminal.

2. **Have your collaborator pick it up.** See if they can continue without asking clarifying questions.

3. **Notice what changes.** Is the standup still necessary? What would you do with that time?

The bet: teams that master async handoffs will move faster than teams that don't. Context is a competitive advantage.


*Egregore is free for teams up to 3 people. Terminal-native, AI-native, no switching costs.*
