Show Curve Labs activity. Follow the /activity command instructions in skills/cl-collaborator/SKILL.md.

Important: Check for sibling project folders (../tristero, ../lace) and show if they exist. Do NOT suggest "/setup" for projects that are already cloned — instead tell user to "cd ../[project] && claude" to work on them.
