Activity dashboard. Display it immediately — no preamble, no narration, no reasoning text. Output the box and nothing else before AskUserQuestion.

Topic: $ARGUMENTS

## Step 1: Fetch data

Run ONE command to get all dashboard data:

```bash
bash bin/activity-data.sh
```

Returns JSON: `me`, `org`, `date`, `my_sessions`, `team_sessions`, `quests`, `pending_questions`, `answered_questions`, `handoffs_to_me`, `all_handoffs`, `knowledge_gap`, `orphans`, `checkins`, `todos_merged`, `focus_history`, `prs`, `disk`, `trends`.

The `todos_merged` object combines `activeTodoCount`, `blockedCount`, `deferredCount`, `staleBlockedCount`, and `lastCheckinDate` in one query result.

The `focus_history` object contains the last 5 sessions where the user selected a Focus option: `shown` (options presented), `selected` (what was chosen), `dismissed` (options not chosen), `date`, `topic`.

The `trends` object contains: `cadence` (sessions per week, 4 weeks), `resolution` (handoff avg days, 30d), `throughput` (todos created vs done, 28d), `capture` (sessions with artifacts / total, 28d).

If the command fails, fall back to reading `memory/` files. Add `(offline)` after ✦ in header.

## Step 2: Render dashboard

Output the TUI box directly. 72 chars wide. Use these frame lines (copy exactly):

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
├──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
└──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

Content rows: `│  {text padded with trailing spaces}  │`

**DO NOT count characters or show reasoning.** Approximate padding is fine — the frame is decorative, not pixel-perfect. Go straight from data to rendered output.

### Sections (separated by `├────┤`)

**Header**: `{ORG} EGREGORE ✦ ACTIVITY DASHBOARD` left, `{me} · {date}` right

**Insight** (1-3 lines): Synthesize what's happening. Warm, concise, connective.
- Use `trends` data when available to enrich synthesis. Compare this week's cadence vs last week ("session cadence up 40%"), note capture ratio ("capture ratio at 75%"), mention throughput ("3 todos created, 5 completed this week"). Only mention trends that are notable — don't list all metrics.
- If `todos_merged.staleBlockedCount > 0`: `{N} todos blocked for 3+ days. /todo check to review.`
- If no check-in in 3+ days (check `todos_merged.lastCheckinDate`) AND `todos_merged.activeTodoCount >= 3`: `{N} active todos, no check-in in {days}d. /todo check to review.`

**Handoffs & Asks** (skip if all empty):
- Handoffs (status=pending) → `[N] ● {from} → you: {topic} ({when})`
- Handoffs (status=read) → `[N] ◐ {from} → you: {topic} ({when})`
- Handoffs (status=done) → `    ○ {from} → you: {topic} (done)`. If `response` field is non-null, append on next line: `      "{response truncated to 50 chars}..."`
- Pending questions → `[N] {from} asks about "{topic}" ({when})`
- Answered questions → `    ✓ {name} answered "{topic}"`
- Other handoffs → `    {from} → {to}: {topic} ({when})`
- Numbered items (● and ◐) first, blank line, then ○ + others.

**Sessions** — ALWAYS render this section. NEVER skip it:
- `◦ YOUR SESSIONS` — read `my_sessions.values` from the JSON. Show top 5. Format: `{date}  {topic}`. If the array is empty, show `(none yet)`.
  - Interleave check-ins from `checkins` (by current user) in chronological order: `{date}  Check-in: {summary}`
- `◦ TEAM` — read `team_sessions.values` from the JSON. This is a DIFFERENT field from my_sessions. Show top 5. Format: `{date}  {name}: {topic}`. If the array is empty, show `(none yet)`.
  - Interleave check-ins from `checkins` (by others) in chronological order: `{date}  {name}: Check-in: {summary}`
- CRITICAL: my_sessions and team_sessions are independent. One can be empty while the other has data. You MUST check both fields separately.
- Blank line between sub-sections.

**Quests & PRs** (skip if both empty):
- `⚑ QUESTS (N active)` — top 5 by score. `{quest-id}` left, `{N} artifacts · {N}d ago` right.
- `→ OPEN PRs` — `#{number}  {title} ({author})`
- Blank line between sub-sections. Omit either if empty.

**Footer** (separated by `├────┤`):
- If orphans.orphanCount > 0: `{N} artifacts unlinked to quests — /quest suggest`
- If knowledge_gap.gapCount > 0: `{N} sessions without captured insights — /reflect to extract`
- Else: `/todo check to review · /ask a question · /quest to see more`
- Always end with: `What's your focus?`

### Date formatting

Today → `Today    ` (9 chars) · Yesterday → `Yesterday` · Older → `Mon DD   ` (9 chars). 2-space gap before topic.

Time ago: <1h `Nm ago` · 1-23h `Nh ago` · 1d `yesterday` · 2-6d `Nd ago` · 7d+ `Mon DD`

### Data freshness

Compare my_sessions for today vs disk.handoffs for today. If disk has more files than graph has sessions for today, show in footer: `{N} sessions on disk not in graph — /save to sync`

## Step 3: Session orientation

Fire AskUserQuestion immediately after the dashboard:

```
header: "Focus"
question: "What would you like to focus on?"
multiSelect: false
```

### Generating options — model-driven, not table-driven

Generate 2-4 options by reasoning over ALL available data. There is no fixed priority table. You have:

- `handoffs_to_me` — pending, read, and done handoffs with status
- `pending_questions` — unanswered questions from teammates
- `my_sessions` — recent work showing what the user has been doing
- `team_sessions` — what others are doing (collaboration opportunities)
- `quests` — active quests with scores and recency
- `prs` — open PRs that may need review
- `focus_history` — **what the user chose and dismissed in recent sessions**
- The full conversation context of this session (what they've already been working on)

**Use `focus_history` to adapt.** This is the key signal:

- If an option was **shown but not selected** across 2+ recent sessions → deprioritize it. The user has seen it and chosen not to engage. Don't keep pushing it to the top.
- If the user consistently selects **work stream continuation** over handoffs → lead with work streams, not handoffs.
- If the user typed **"Other" with custom text** → that tells you what they actually wanted. Use it to inform future option generation.
- If `focus_history` is empty (first session or new user) → fall back to surfacing pending handoffs and questions first, then work streams.

**Use current session context to adapt.** If the user has already been working on something in this session before running `/activity`, the options should reflect continuation of that work, not ignore it.

**Work stream detection:** Cluster recent sessions by theme. Name specifically — not "Continue recent work" but "Query optimization + batch endpoints" or "Pricing strategy refinement." Hint at what's next, not what's done.

**Constraints:**
- Minimum 2 options, maximum 4. "Other" is automatic (provided by AskUserQuestion).
- Every option must be grounded in actual data — no generic labels.
- Handoffs with status `done` are excluded from options entirely.
- Handoffs with status `read` are lower priority than `pending` but not excluded — the user may want to revisit.

### Recording the selection

After the user selects, record what happened for future sessions:

```
  ✦ Remembering...
```

Compute the dismissed options (shown minus selected) and record:
```bash
bash bin/graph-op.sh record-focus "$SESSION_ID" '$SHOWN_JSON' "$SELECTED" '$DISMISSED_JSON'
```

Where `$SESSION_ID` is the most recent session from `my_sessions`, `$SHOWN_JSON` is the array of option labels shown, `$SELECTED` is the chosen label, and `$DISMISSED_JSON` is the array of labels not chosen. If the user typed custom text via "Other", use their text as the selected value.

This runs silently — do not show output. Proceed immediately to the action.

### After selection

| Selection | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| Handoff | Read filePath from data. Display content + entry points. **Immediately** mark as read: output `  ✦ Remembering...` then run `bash bin/graph-op.sh mark-read $sessionId`. Then proceed — no follow-up question. Resolution happens automatically at next dashboard load (Q_resolve) or via `/activity done N`. |
| Questions | Load QuestionSet, present via AskUserQuestion. |
| Work stream | Read most recent handoff from cluster. Show Open Threads / Next Steps. Mention relevant knowledge artifacts. |
| PR | `gh pr view #N --json title,body,additions,deletions,files`. Summarize. |
| New / Other | Ask: "What are you working on?" |

## Argument filtering

- `/activity quests` — expand quests, show all with full counts
- `/activity @name` — filter to that person's sessions
- `/activity done [N]` — resolve handoff N. Fetch activity data, map Nth ●/◐ handoff to sessionId. Output `  ✦ Resolving...` then run `bash bin/graph-op.sh mark-done $sessionId`. Output: `✓ Resolved: {topic} from {author}`
- `/activity analytics` — Run `bash bin/analytics-data.sh` instead of the normal data script. Render full org health using all 10 metrics (cadence, resolution, quest velocity, collaboration density, todo health, throughput, capture ratio, question response, check-in frequency, issue lifecycle). Same TUI box, 72-char frame. Model decides layout — no rigid template. Group metrics by theme (velocity, collaboration, health). Highlight notable patterns, comparisons between people, and week-over-week changes.

## Rules

- `bash bin/activity-data.sh` for ALL data — never call graph.sh directly for reads
- Use `bash bin/graph-op.sh <operation>` for all graph writes (mark-read, mark-done, etc.) — never raw Cypher
- Before any graph write, output a thinking indicator: `  ✦ Remembering...` or `  ✦ Resolving...`
- No sub-boxes — only outer frame `│` and `├────┤` separators
- DO NOT output reasoning, character counting, or analysis — render directly
