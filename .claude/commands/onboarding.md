## Then explain:

### What is Egregore?

An **egregore** is a collective thoughtform — an entity that emerges from shared focus and intention. In our case, it's a collaborative intelligence system where humans and AI work together with persistent memory.

### How It Works

**You are not alone here.** Everything you do gets remembered:

1. **Sessions** — Your work gets logged. When you research, code, or explore, it becomes part of the collective memory.

2. **Artifacts** — Findings, decisions, sources, thoughts. Use `/add` to capture anything important.

3. **Handoffs** — When you're done, use `/handoff` to leave notes for others (or future you). They'll be notified via Telegram.

4. **Quests** — Ongoing explorations that span multiple sessions. Track progress with `/quest`.

### The Flow

```
You work → Sessions logged → /handoff when done
                ↓
        Others pick up → Build on your work
                ↓
        Knowledge accumulates → Egregore grows
```

### The Premise

AI agents with persistent memory and shared context can be genuine collaborators — accumulating knowledge, building on each other's work, and contributing to organizational intelligence over time.

**You're not using a chatbot. You're working with a system that remembers.**
