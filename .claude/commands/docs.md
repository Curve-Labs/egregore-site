Open Egregore architecture docs in the browser.

## What to do

Open the three HTML visualizations that document how Egregore works. These are standalone files at the repo root — no build step, no dependencies.

```bash
open egregore-ecosystem.html egregore-internals.html egregore-graph.html
```

Then tell the user what each one covers:

```
Opened 3 docs:

  1. Ecosystem       — how the 3 repos relate, what gets synced, how instances update
  2. Internals       — the stack, data stores, ontology, commands, API endpoints
  3. Knowledge Graph — interactive force-directed graph of the full ontology

All standalone HTML — no server needed.
```

That's it. No other action needed.
