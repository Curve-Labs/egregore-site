## The Garden Metaphor

Knowledge doesn't accumulate by itself. It needs tending.

## Seeds and Soil

Every session plants seeds — decisions, patterns, insights. The soil is your shared memory.

## Pruning and Connecting

Not everything grows. Some ideas need pruning. Others need connecting to flourish.

## The Harvest

When knowledge compounds, teams move faster. Context becomes a shared resource, not a bottleneck.
