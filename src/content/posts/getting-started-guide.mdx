## Installation

Get up and running in minutes.

```bash
npx create-egregore
```

## Your First Session

When you launch Egregore, you'll see the activity dashboard — recent sessions, handoffs, and quests from your team.

## Essential Commands

The commands you'll use every day:

- `/activity` — See what's happening
- `/handoff` — End your session with context for the next person
- `/ask` — Ask questions to teammates or search knowledge
- `/reflect` — Capture insights and patterns

## Daily Workflow

1. Start with `/activity` to orient
2. Work normally with Claude Code
3. End with `/handoff` to preserve context
